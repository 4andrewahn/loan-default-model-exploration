### About the project
This project was built as a data cleaning and data modeling exploration. I have included explanations of my intuition behind the data cleaning methods used. I also explore the pros and cons of 3 regression models as well as compare metrics of their predictions. 

### Technical details
**Data Cleaning Methods:**
- Deletion
- Categorical Data Encoding
- Mode Imputation
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation  
- Feature Scaling 

**Predictive Modeling Methods:**
- 80/20 Train-Test Split 
- Logistic Regression Model
- Classification Tree Model 
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Model 
- Metrics to measure performance:
    - Accuracy
    - Precision
    - Recall
